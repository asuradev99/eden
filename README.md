A GPU-accelerated cellular automaton simulator in Rust, using Vulkan.

Currently WIP

## todo list
- GUI 
    - Switch between different shaders (coloumb's, )
    - Add / edit position of particles in shader mode
    - Force Matrix (3)
    - Scrolling issue
  
- Camera
   - Auto-zoom


- Simulation
  - Collisions or repelling force (possible gas simulation) (2)
  - Implement particle types w/ coloring (3)
  - Barnes-Hut or Spatial Sorting Algorithm (4)
  - Lighting effects
  - Display each particle as a shape / circle (1)
