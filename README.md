A GPU-accelerated cellular automaton simulator in Rust, using Vulkan.

Currently WIP

## todo list
- GUI 
  [ ] Fix transparency
  [ ] Allow gravity / param change with sim reload
  [ ] Switch between different shaders (coloumb's, )
  [ ] Add / edit position of particles in shader mode
  
- Camera
  [ ] Display world coordinates, not clip coordinates
  [ ] Add scroll zoom and right-click drag translation (rotation in 3d)

- Simulation
  [ ] Coloumb's Law
  [ ] Collisions (possible gas simulation)
  [ ] Boundary condition handling
  [ ] Lighting effects
